# Guidelines

In _Data Structures & Applications_, as much or more than in any other class, there are a ton of different ways to get where we need to go. Moreover, we all have different prior experiences and learning-related preferences. Try everything and keep track of your progress here.

Each assignment or project you work on can have its own page with subpages for each part of your process. Guidelines for pages and subpages:

* LeetCode problems and other classwork are meant to help you practice one thing at a time. No need for more than one page each. Check out this guide to get the most out of practice problems: [https://anthonydmays.com/blog/2022/05/09/how-to-practice-leetcode-problems-the-right-way/](https://anthonydmays.com/blog/2022/05/09/how-to-practice-leetcode-problems-the-right-way/)
* Homework projects on the other hand are designed to combine multiple concepts and competencies, so you may have subpages for different parts of a project.
* Create these pages as if you are reminding your future self what you want to remember. You will almost certainly run into the same hiccups and bugs in future problems and projects. Think of your portfolio as notes for your future self.
* Include a description of your process: What did you do and learn? Where did you get stuck? Where did you find help? If you worked with a partner or group, how did you manage division of labor and what were your specific contributions? What did you learn from your collaborators?
* After submitting your work on GitHub classroom, you may also include a link to your repositories here. When you go to _Insert Subpage,_ you have options to insert a new document page or a new link.

## Programming in Python

{% hint style="success" %}
Whether or not this is your first class in Python, you may find it helpful to spend time reviewing Python3 paradigms and syntax.

## All things data structures

{% hint style="success" %}
We will learn about a variety of data structures along with their respective advantages and trade offs. LeetCode problems are typically tagged by which data structures they're intended to incorporate. Homework projects will also likely center one data structure: the one that's the best fit for the given context and application.\
\
One way to organize this portion of your portfolio would be to have one page for each data structure, which includes links to and notes on each of the related practice problems you chose. Homework projects can be described separately in subpages.
{% endhint %}

## Design and analysis

{% hint style="success" %}
We will also dive into programming concepts such as asymptotics, time-complexity, and space-complexity, i.e., that not all programs are created equalâ€“two programs that perform the same task may not do so with the same efficiency or cleanliness.\
\
Not only does LeetCode give you space to practice solving problems, it also shows you how efficiently your accepted solution runs. This is a good opportunity to iterate on your code and see if you can solve the same problem using less time and space. \
\
Use this group of pages/subpages to keep track of strategies and patterns you discover.

## Bi-weekly reflections

Every 2 weeks, take some time to respond to the prompts provided and then make notes of your participation and engagement with a _Student Service Report (SSR)_. Your contributions to class discussions, notes, and study group time uplift everyone. Also, if you like, maybe use this space to give yourself props for taking good care of your physical, social, and emotional well-being. Balance is key. :clap:
