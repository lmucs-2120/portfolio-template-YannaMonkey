(optional) Go over your list, considering Martha Beck's 3 B's:

* **Bag** it: do you really _have to_ do it? Is it aligned with what you want? What would happen if you did not do it? Can you live with that?\
  \
  If it _must_ be done, consider...
* **Barter** it: can someone else do it (and maybe you can do something you dread less that would be helpful for them)? \
  \
  If not, then...
* **Better** it: how can you make yourself extra comfortable while you do the thing? Find a quiet space or good playlist, your favorite snacks, and softest socks.
