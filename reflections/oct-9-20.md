If you were to assign yourself a letter grade (and/or meme and/or gif) to represent the quality of your work so far, what would it be?
{% endhint %}
I think that if I was going to assign myself a letter grade, I think I would give myself an A

...

{% hint style="info" %}
Why did you choose the above letter grade/meme/gif?
{% endhint %}
I chose an A because I have not taken a class sith this much self-direction, and I think that I have been doing a decent job of getting myself to do work.

* [* ] I'm satisfied with my effort, output, and learning in this class so far. I will continue with this pace.
* [ ] I'm not so satisfied with my progress so far, but I will discuss this at our midterm check-in and course-correct.
* [ *] I have been stretching myself too thin.
* [ ] I know I could do more/better if I had more effective strategies for managing my time and/or stress.

**SSR for weeks 7 & 8**

We went over a temperature problem and showed how to solve it with brute force, and how to use the stack to help with time complexity and solve it more easily
I also did the car leet code problem that was recommended to do afterward
