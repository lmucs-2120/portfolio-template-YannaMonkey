**SSR for weeks 11 & 12**

the first week we had no class, so I took that time to start writing my final essay for one of my other classes.
In week 12 we talked about complexity analysis, which I think is a really cool concept, and is probably something that I should understand well.

**Goals for weeks 13 & 14**

My goal for Week 13 is to enjoy my Thanksgiving break.
And my goal for week 14 is to hopefully get myself to do some more leet code problems and to finish making my presentation for my Greek History Class.w
