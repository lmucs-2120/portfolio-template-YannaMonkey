What have you been working on learning these weeks? How is it going?
{% endhint %}

I started to learn more about binary trees. I had a math test this week and I don't think that I did that good. I also actually started working on my portfolio.

**SSR for weeks 9 & 10**

In week 9 we didn't have class due to midterm meetings, and in week 10 I learned how to validate a binary tree.

**Goals for weeks 11 & 12**

I hope I can convince myself to do some practice problems about binary trees because I don't think I fully understand them yet.
