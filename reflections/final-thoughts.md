# Final thoughts

{% hint style="info" %}
What was this semester like for you (in CMSI 2120 and/or in general)?
{% endhint %}


I enjoyed this semester a lot. As a transfer student, I was initially worried about making new friends while keeping up with my classes. With my classes, I think I performed fairly well, although I did struggle with some, like linear algebra. However, I also managed to make some cool friends who were transfer students as well. Specifically in CMSI, I particularly enjoyed the class because it allowed me to learn at my own pace, which was less stressful compared to my previous computer science classes where I had to turn in multiple assignments each week.

If you remember one thing from this class, what will it be and why?
{% endhint %}

One thing that stood out to me the most was learning about the blockchain. Maybe it was because it was the most recent thing that was taught in class. But I thought that it was interesting because I never actually knew what it was, I had just heard about it through crypto. Another concept that stood out to me was hash tables. I thought this one was interesting because I had heard about the other concepts before. But I had never heard of a hashtable, and after learning about them, I think that they are a very cool way to store information.

What do you want to learn/do next?
{% endhint %}

I hope to learn more in my next computer science class and be able to use the topics I learned in this class in my next one. I also hope that after this class I will still be able to push myself to do/learn things on my own because after this semester I learned that it is a very important skill to have. And in the computer science aspect, I would like to learn more about how video games are programmed, because I think that programming a video game would be really cool.

Are there things you wish could have been different about this class?
{% endhint %}


One thing that I wish was different about this class is that there were more check-ins, as they could have provided a sort of deadline to motivate me more. I think that with more check-ins, I would have had more motivation to work. It takes a lot of motivation for me to work on something when the deadline is not near. So, I believe that having a few more check-ins would have been helpful.
