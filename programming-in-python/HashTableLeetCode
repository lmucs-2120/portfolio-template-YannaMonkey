class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {} 

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num

            if complement in seen:
                return [seen[complement], i] 

            seen[num] = i 

        return []  

This was a leetcode problem that I did to help further my understand of hash tables.
