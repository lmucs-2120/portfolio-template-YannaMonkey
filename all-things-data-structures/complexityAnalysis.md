Time Complexity Analysis

Big O is the way of representing it
examples

O(1): The execution time of the algorithm is constant and does not depend on the input size.

O(log n): The execution time grows logarithmically with the input size. This is common in algorithms that divide the problem in half each time, like binary search.

O(n): The execution time grows linearly with the input size. An example is a simple loop through an array.

O(nÂ²): The time grows quadratically with the input size. This often occurs with nested loops over the data.

O(2^n): The time grows exponentially with the input size and is common in some recursive algorithms.
